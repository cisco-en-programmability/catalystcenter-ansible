description:
  - Get all Location Servers Cmx Servers Certificate. - > Gets the CA certificate details, if available, of a CMX Server by
    connection address. This can be used to establish trust with the CMX Server within Catalyst Center, by saving the `certificate`
    attribute as a `.pem` file and uploading through `POST /dna/intent/api/v1/trustedCertificates/import` API. The content
    of the certificate must be reviewed and validated by the end user to ensure they trust the certificate that is presented
    prior to importing into Catalyst Center.
