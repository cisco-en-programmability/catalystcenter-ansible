        Views query parameter. The specific views being requested. This is an optional parameter which can be
        passed to get one or more of the network device data. If this is not provided, then it will default to
        `BASIC` views. If multiple views are provided, the response will contain the union of the views.
        Attributes covered by the views are * `BASIC` id, managementAddress, dnsResolvedManagementIpAddress,
        hostname, macAddress, serialNumbers, type, family, series, status, platformIds, softwareType,
        softwareVersion, vendor, stackDevice, bootTime, role, roleSource, apEthernetMacAddress,
        apManagerInterfaceIpAddress, apWlcIpAddress, deviceSupportLevel, snmpContact, snmpLocation, secureMode *
        `RESYNC` id, managementAddress, dnsResolvedManagementIpAddress, hostname, macAddress, serialNumbers,
        type, family, series, status, reachabilityStatus, reachabilityFailureReason, managementState,
        lastSuccessfulResyncReasons, resyncStartTime, resyncEndTime, resyncReasons, resyncRequestedByApps,
        pendingResyncRequestCount, pendingResyncRequestReasons, resyncIntervalSource, resyncIntervalMinutes,
        errorCode, errorDescription, secureMode * `USER_DEFINED_FIELDS` id, managementAddress,
        dnsResolvedManagementIpAddress, hostname, macAddress, serialNumbers, type, family, series, status,
        userDefinedFields * `CREDENTIALS` (without sensitive credentials) id, managementAddress,
        dnsResolvedManagementIpAddress, hostname, macAddress, serialNumbers, type, family, series, status,
        credentials, category Note `CREDENTIALS` view only returns the non-sensitive credentials of the network
        device. The sensitive credentials are not returned in the response.

        ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        ------------------ | | `MANAGED` | The device is successfully managed. | | `SYNC_NOT_STARTED` | Sync
        request is queued and pending processing. | | `SYNC_INIT_FAILED` | Sync initialization failed due to
        bootstrap issues. | | `SYNC_PRECHECK_FAILED` | Device failed to meet necessary preconditions for sync. |
        | `SYNC_IN_PROGRESS` | Sync with the device is in progress. | | `SYNC_INTERNAL_ERROR` | Encountered an
        internal error during data collection, potentially leading to incomplete or outdated device information.
        | | `SYNC_DISABLED` | Sync has been disabled on the device. | | `DELETING_DEVICE` | The device is being
        deleted from Catalyst Center. | | `UNDER_MAINTENANCE` | The device is in maintenance mode. Assurance
        will not raise alerts when the network device is in maintenance mode. | | `QUARANTINED` | The device is
        in quarantined state. Inventory sync and provisioning are disabled for the device. | | `UNASSOCIATED` |
        Access point is not associated with any WLC. | | `UNREACHABLE` | The device is not reachable by either
        SNMP/HTTP/NETCONF or ICMP. | | `UNKNOWN` | All information from the device could not be collected, or
        inventory collection was not started. It may be a temporary issue. Attempt to resync the device, and if
        the error persists, contact Cisco TAC. |.

        device. The device is reachable only by ICMP. * `UNREACHABLE` - Device is not reachable by either
        SNMP/HTTP or ICMP. * `UNKNOWN` - Device reachability status can't be determined. The product hasn't
        interacted with the device yet, or the parent device that controls the device is unreachable.
