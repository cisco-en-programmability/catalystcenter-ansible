module: tracked_clients_bulk_update_create
short_description: Resource module for Tracked Clients Bulk Update Create
description:
  - Manage operation create of the resource Tracked Clients Bulk Update Create. - > Partially updates multiple MAC-based tracked-client
    configurations in one request. Catalyst Center supports up to 2000 tracked-client configurations at a time. Each item
    is processed independently. Omitted fields keep their existing values. Each item must include `clientMacAddress` and at
    least one of `description`, `trackingStartTime`, `trackingEndTime`, or `notificationModes`. Use `trackingStartTime 0`
    to restart tracking at the current server time and `trackingEndTime 0` for never-expiring tracking. Unknown `clientMacAddress`
    targets are returned as item-level `FAILURE` results and are not created as a side effect of bulk update.
version_added: '2.11.0'
