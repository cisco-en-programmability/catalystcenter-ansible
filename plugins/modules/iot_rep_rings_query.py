short_description: Resource module for Iot Rep Rings Query
description:
  - Manage operation create of the resource Iot Rep Rings Query. - > This API returns the list of REP rings for the given
    fields - networkDeviceId Network device ID of the REP ring member. In case of successful REP ring creation, any of the
    REP ring member networkDeviceId can be provided. In case of failed REP ring creation, provide only root node networkDeviceId.
    The networkDeviceId is the instanceUuid attribute in the response of API - /dna/intent/api/v1/networkDevice and deploymentMode
    FABRIC/NON_FABRIC .
