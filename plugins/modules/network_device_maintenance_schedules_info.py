module: network_device_maintenance_schedules_info
short_description: Information module for Network Device Maintenance Schedules
description:
  - Get all Network Device Maintenance Schedules.
  - Get Network Device Maintenance Schedules by id.
  - API to retrieve the maintenance schedule information for the given id. - > This API retrieves a list of scheduled maintenance
    windows for network devices based on filter parameters. Each maintenance window is composed of a start schedule and end
    schedule, both of which have unique identifiers `startId` and `endId`. These identifiers can be used to fetch the status
    of the start schedule and end schedule using the `GET /dna/intent/api/v1/activities/{id}` API. Completed maintenance schedules
    are automatically removed from the system after two weeks.
version_added: '2.0.0'

        Status query parameter. The status of the maintenance schedule. Possible values are - `UPCOMING` The
        maintenance is scheduled and pending execution. - `IN_PROGRESS` The maintenance is currently in
        progress. - `COMPLETED` The maintenance window has been fully completed (For recurring maintenance, this
        indicates completion of the most recent occurrence). - `FAILED` Updating the device's management state
        was not successful. For more information on failure use `GET /dna/intent/api/v1/activities/{id}` API
        with `startId` and `endId` value.
