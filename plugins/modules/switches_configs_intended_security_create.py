short_description: Resource module for Switches Configs Intended Security Create
description:
  - Manage operation create of the resource Switches Configs Intended Security Create. - > This API creates configurations
    for an intended feature on a wired device. Once all the updates to intended features are complete, they can be deployed
    to a device using the API /api/v1/switches/{id}/configs/intended/deploy. When the intended features are deployed, they
    are applied on top of the existing configurations on the device. Any existing configurations on the device which are not
    included in the intended features, are retained on the device. The device config learning must have enabled for the switch
    using the API /dna/campus/api/v1/switches/configs/deployed/enable and Error code NCCO15475 can be observed if not enabled.
