module: network_devices_insecure_configurations_info
short_description: Information module for Network Devices Insecure Configurations
description:
  - Get all Network Devices Insecure Configurations. - > Retrieves the list of insecure CLI configurations currently applied
    on the network device identified by network device `id`. Insecure configurations are CLI commands that use deprecated,
    weak, or non-compliant security settings and are restricted on IOS-XE devices beginning with release `26.1.1`. These include
    configurations that rely on outdated security protocols, insecure authentication mechanisms, or any commands flagged as
    non-secure by the device.
