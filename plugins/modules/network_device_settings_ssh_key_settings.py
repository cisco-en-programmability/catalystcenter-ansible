module: network_device_settings_ssh_key_settings
short_description: Resource module for Network Device Settings Ssh Key Settings
description:
  - Manage operation update of the resource Network Device Settings Ssh Key Settings. - > This API lets users control how
    the system handles new SSH key from network devices during SSH connections. With the `autoAcceptSshKeys` flag set to `false`,
    the system will block the SSH connection if a network device presents a new SSH key. If the flag is set to `true`, the
    system will automatically accept the SSH key. Users can also use the device-specific `/dna/intent/api/v1/networkDevices/acceptSshKeyChange`
    API to approve SSH key changes individually when the global auto-accept is turned off.
