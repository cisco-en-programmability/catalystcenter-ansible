short_description: Resource module for Wireless Profiles Id Site Tags Bulk
description:
  - Manage operation create of the resource Wireless Profiles Id Site Tags Bulk. - > This endpoint allows the creation of
    multiple `Site Tags` associated with a specific `Wireless Profile` in a single request. The `id` of the `Wireless Profile`
    must be provided as a path parameter, and a list of `Site Tags` should be included in the request body. `Note ` Only one
    Site Tag siteTag can be created per siteId. If multiple siteTags are specified for the same siteId within a request, only
    the last one will be saved, overriding any previously configured tags. When creating a Site Tag under a Flex-enabled Wireless
    Profile i.e., a Wireless Profile with one or more Flex SSIDs , a non-default Flex Profile Name flexProfileName will be
    used. If no custom flexProfileName is defined, the System will automatically generate one and configure it in the controller.

      load:
        description: "Configure a `load` factor for this Site Tag. - The load factor is defined on a scale of 0 to 1000. As
          a starting point, you can set the load factor to match the number of APs, with adjustments made for any unusual
          or exceptional client loads. - This feature is supported in IOS-XE versions 17.9.3 and above. - The default `load`
          value is null. Leaving it as `null` does not reset the controller's existing value; any previously configured `load`
          value remains unchanged on the controller. - All APs on controller must disconnect and reconnect for load balancing
          to take effect. - Examples - Custom Load - `load` is set to 10. - After provisioning, the `load` value (10) is pushed
          to the controller for the Site Tag. - Out Of Band (OOB) Load - For a Site Tag, `load` is configured as 10 directly
          on controller (Out-Of-Band). - No `load` value is set through this API, upon provisioning no value will be pushed
          to the controller. - The existing `load` value (10) for the Site Tag is retained on the controller. - Reset Load
          - `load` is configured as 10 within the Site Tag and successfully provisioned to the controller. - `load` is reset
          to null in the design via `PUT` API. - During provisioning, no value is pushed to the controller, and the previous
          `load` value (10) for the Site Tag is retained on controller. - Load configuration for indexed Site Tags - Assign
          the load value relative to AP count or other load factors like client density for the Site Tag. - Flex Site Tag
          - Can support up to 300 APs. - If `load` is configured as 1000 and 600 AP's are provisioned, Catalyst Centre will
          automatically create 2 indexed Site Tags, each with Load = 1000. - Non Flex Site Tag - Can support up to 1600 APs.
          - If `load` is configured as 1000 and 2000 AP's are provisioned, the system will automatically create 2 indexed
          Site Tags, each with Load = 1000."
