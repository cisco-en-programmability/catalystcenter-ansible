module: wireless_controllers_intended_ssids_policy_tags
short_description: Resource module for Wireless Controllers Intended Ssids Policy Tags
description:
  - Manage operations create, update and delete of the resource Wireless Controllers Intended Ssids Policy Tags. - > This
    API operation creates an intended PolicyTag resource, and the subsequent "deploy" API call will configure the changes
    on the underlying wireless controller, and this API is applicable for per-device based configuration. - > This API operation
    deletes an intended PolicyTag resource, and the subsequent "deploy" API call will configure the changes on the underlying
    wireless controller, and this API is applicable for per-device based configuration. Delete operations are not supported
    for default-policy-tag in any version. - > This API operation updates an intended PolicyTag resource, and the subsequent
    "deploy" API call will configure the changes on the underlying wireless controller, and this API is applicable for per-device
    based configuration. When the intended features are deployed, they are applied on top of the existing configurations on
    the device. Any existing configurations on the device which are not included in the intended features, are retained on
    the device.
