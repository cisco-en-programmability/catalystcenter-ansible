        Status query parameter. Inventory related status of the network device. | status | Description | |
        ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        ------------------ | | `MANAGED` | The device is successfully managed. | | `SYNC_NOT_STARTED` | Sync
        request is queued and pending processing. | | `SYNC_INIT_FAILED` | Sync initialization failed due to
        bootstrap issues. | | `SYNC_PRECHECK_FAILED` | Device failed to meet necessary preconditions for sync. |
        | `SYNC_IN_PROGRESS` | Sync with the device is in progress. | | `SYNC_INTERNAL_ERROR` | Encountered an
        internal error during data collection, potentially leading to incomplete or outdated device information.
        | | `SYNC_DISABLED` | Sync has been disabled on the device. | | `DELETING_DEVICE` | The device is being
        deleted from Catalyst Center. | | `UNDER_MAINTENANCE` | The device is in maintenance mode. Assurance
        will not raise alerts when the network device is in maintenance mode. | | `QUARANTINED` | The device is
        in quarantined state. Inventory sync and provisioning are disabled for the device. | | `UNASSOCIATED` |
        Access point is not associated with any WLC. | | `UNREACHABLE` | The device is not reachable by either
        SNMP/HTTP/NETCONF or ICMP. | | `UNKNOWN` | All information from the device could not be collected, or
        inventory collection was not started. It may be a temporary issue. Attempt to resync the device, and if
        the error persists, contact Cisco TAC. |.
    type: str
  reachabilityStatus:

        ReachabilityStatus query parameter. Reachability status of the network device. Possible values are *
        `REACHABLE` - Device is reachable by SNMP (in case of network device) or HTTP (in case of compute device
        or Meraki device). * `ONLY_PING_REACHABLE` - Mandatory protocol (SNMP/HTTP/NETCONF) failed for the
        device. The device is reachable only by ICMP. * `UNREACHABLE` - Device is not reachable by either
        SNMP/HTTP or ICMP. * `UNKNOWN` - Device reachability status can't be determined. The product hasn't
        interacted with the device yet, or the parent device that controls the device is unreachable.
    type: str
  managementState:
    description:
      - >
        ManagementState query parameter. The status of the network device's manageability. Possible values are *
        `MANAGED` Device is managed. * `UNDER_MAINTENANCE` Device is in service maintenance. * `NEVER_MANAGED`
        Device has never been managed.
