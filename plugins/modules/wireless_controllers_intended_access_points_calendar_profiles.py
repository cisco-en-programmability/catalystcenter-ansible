short_description: Resource module for Wireless Controllers Intended Access Points Calendar Profiles
description:
  - Manage operations create, update and delete of the resource Wireless Controllers Intended Access Points Calendar Profiles.
    - > This API operation creates an intended CalendarProfile resource, and the subsequent "deploy" API call will configure
    the changes on the underlying wireless controller, and this API is applicable for per-device based configuration. - >
    This API operation deletes an intended CalendarProfile resource, and the subsequent "deploy" API call will configure the
    changes on the underlying wireless controller, and this API is applicable for per-device based configuration. - > This
    API operation updates an intended CalendarProfile resource, and the subsequent "deploy" API call will configure the changes
    on the underlying wireless controller, and this API is applicable for per-device based configuration. When the intended
    features are deployed, they are applied on top of the existing configurations on the device. Any existing configurations
    on the device which are not included in the intended features, are retained on the device.
