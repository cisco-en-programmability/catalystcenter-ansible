module: traffic_steering_firewalls_top_n_analytics_info
short_description: Information module for Traffic Steering Firewalls Top N Analytics
description:
  - Get all Traffic Steering Firewalls Top N Analytics. - > This API retrieves the top firewalls used by traffic steering
    policies across the network. It provides comprehensive analytics on firewalls that are most frequently utilized in directing
    and managing network traffic. By accessing this data, network administrators can gain valuable insights into how firewalls
    are performing, which ones are most active, and how they contribute to overall network security and efficiency. This information
    is crucial for optimizing network security policies, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and ensuring effective traffic
    management. The API supports strategic decision-making and resource allocation by highlighting the firewalls that play
    a key role in maintaining network integrity and performance.
