description:
  - Manage operation delete of the resource Switches Configs Intended Security Delete. - > This API deletes the configurations
    for an intended feature on a switch. Once all the updates to intended features are complete, they can be deployed to a
    device using the API /api/v1/switches/{id}/configs/intended/deploy. When the intended features are deployed, they are
    applied on top of the existing configurations on the device. Any existing configurations on the device which are not included
    in the intended features, are retained on the device.
