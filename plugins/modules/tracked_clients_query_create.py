description:
  - Manage operation create of the resource Tracked Clients Query Create.
  - Returns tracked-client configurations matching the provided request-body filters.

  filters:
    description: List of filters to apply when querying tracked-client configurations. Supported operators by field are `clientMacAddress`,
      `duid`, `description` eq, neq, in, notIn, like, liker `trackingStartTime`, `trackingEndTime` eq, neq, lt, gt, lte, gte
      `isPresentOnNetwork` eq, neq `randomizedMacAddresses` eq, neq, in, notIn, like, liker `notificationModes` in, notIn
      For `trackingEndTime`, value `0` represents never-expiring tracking. Nested filter composition is supported through
      `logicalOperator` and nested `filters`. Only one level of nested filters is supported.
