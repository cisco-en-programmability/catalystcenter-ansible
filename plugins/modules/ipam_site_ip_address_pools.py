    subpool, which reserves address space from a global pool or global pools for a particular site and it's child sites. A
    subpool may be either IPv4 with an `ipV4AddressSpace` specified , IPv6 with an `ipV6AddressSpace` specified or Dual-stack
    with both an `ipV4AddressSpace` and `ipV6AddressSpace` specified .
  - Releases an IP address subpool.
  - Updates an IP address subpool, which reserves address space from a global pool or global pools for a particular site.
