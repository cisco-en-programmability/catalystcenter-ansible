description:
  - Manage operation create of the resource Switches Configs Intended Layer3 Create. - > This API creates configurations for
    an intended feature on a wired device. Once all the updates to intended features are complete, they can be deployed to
    a device using the API /api/v1/switches/{id}/configs/intended/deploy. When the intended features are deployed, they are
    applied on top of the existing configurations on the device. Any existing configurations on the device which are not included
    in the intended features, are retained on the device. The device config learning must have enabled for the switch using
    the API /dna/campus/api/v1/switches/configs/enable and Error code NCCO15475 can be observed if not enabled.
