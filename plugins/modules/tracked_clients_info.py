module: tracked_clients_info
short_description: Information module for Tracked Clients
description:
  - Get all Tracked Clients.
  - Get Tracked Clients by id.
  - Returns one tracked-client configuration for the given client identifier.
  - Returns tracked-client configurations for the customer-facing intent API.

options:

    description: Additional headers.
    type: dict
  id:
    description:
      - >
        Id path parameter. Tracked-client identifier. This is the MAC address stored on the tracked-client
        configuration. The stored identifier may be either the client's canonical MAC address or a randomized
        MAC address. Correlated randomized MACs listed in `randomizedMacAddresses` are not interchangeable
        resource identifiers for this path.
    type: str
  offset:
    description:
      - >
        Offset query parameter. Specifies the starting point within all records returned by the API. It's one
        based offset. The starting value is 1.
    type: int
  limit:
    description:
      - Limit query parameter. Maximum number of records to return.
    type: int
  clientMacAddress:
    description:
      - >
        ClientMacAddress query parameter. Up to 10 stored tracked-client identifiers to match. Each value is
        matched against the MAC address stored on the tracked-client configuration. The stored identifier may be
        either the client's canonical MAC address or a randomized MAC address. To filter by correlated
        randomized MAC aliases, use `randomizedMacAddresses`. Invalid MAC address values are rejected.
    elements: str
    type: list
  duid:
    description:
      - >
        Duid query parameter. Up to 10 DUID values to match. A DUID is the device identifier used to correlate
        related randomized MACs for the same client.
    elements: str
    type: list
  description:
    description:
      - >
        Description query parameter. Exact-match description value for tracked-client configurations. This
        parameter uses `eq` semantics only. For partial matching or other request-body filter combinations, use
        `POST /intent/api/v1/trackedClients/query`.
    type: str
  notificationModes:
    description:
      - >
        NotificationModes query parameter. One or more notification modes to match. Supported values are
        `CONNECT_FIRST`, `CONNECT_EVERY`, and `DISCONNECT_EVERY`.
    elements: str
    type: list
  isPresentOnNetwork:
    description:
      - >
        IsPresentOnNetwork query parameter. Match tracked-client configurations by whether the client is present
        on the network within the last 28 days.
    type: bool
  randomizedMacAddresses:
    description:
      - >
        RandomizedMacAddresses query parameter. Up to 10 randomized MAC addresses to match against the tracked
        client. These addresses are matched through the client-correlation data associated with the DUID when
        available.
