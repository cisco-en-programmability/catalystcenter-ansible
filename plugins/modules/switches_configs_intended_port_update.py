short_description: Resource module for Switches Configs Intended Port Update
description:
  - Manage operation update of the resource Switches Configs Intended Port Update. - > This API updates the configurations
    for an intended feature on a switch. Updates to other intended features can be done over several iterations. Once all
    the updates to intended features are complete, they can be deployed to a device using the API /api/v1/switches/{id}/configs/intended/deploy.
    When the intended features are deployed, they are applied on top of the existing configurations on the device. Any existing
    configurations on the device which are not included in the intended features, are retained on the device.
