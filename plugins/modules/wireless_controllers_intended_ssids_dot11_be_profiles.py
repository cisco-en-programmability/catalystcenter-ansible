module: wireless_controllers_intended_ssids_dot11_be_profiles
short_description: Resource module for Wireless Controllers Intended Ssids Dot11 Be Profiles
description:
  - Manage operations create, update and delete of the resource Wireless Controllers Intended Ssids Dot11 Be Profiles. - >
    This API operation creates an intended Dot11BeProfile resource, and the subsequent "deploy" API call will configure the
    changes on the underlying wireless controller, and this API is applicable for per-device based configuration. Default
    802.11be profiles can be created starting from version 17.15. Custom 802.11be profiles support creation from version 17.18
    onwards. - > This API operation deletes an intended Dot11BeProfile resource, and the subsequent "deploy" API call will
    configure the changes on the underlying wireless controller, and this API is applicable for per-device based configuration.
    Delete operations are not supported for default 802.11be profiles in any version. Custom 802.11be profiles support delete
    operations from version 17.18 onwards. - > This API operation updates an intended Dot11BeProfile resource, and the subsequent
    "deploy" API call will configure the changes on the underlying wireless controller, and this API is applicable for per-device
    based configuration. Default 802.11be profiles support update operations from version 17.15. Custom 802.11be profiles
    can be updated starting from version 17.18. When the intended features are deployed, they are applied on top of the existing
    configurations on the device. Any existing configurations on the device which are not included in the intended features,
    are retained on the device.
