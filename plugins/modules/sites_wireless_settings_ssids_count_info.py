        _inherited query parameter. `_inherited` query parameter indicates wether the current SSID count at
        `siteId` is of the SSID it is inheriting or count of non-inheriting SSIDs. - When `_inherited` is
        `false` then - Should a request include a non-global `siteId` with the `_inherited` flag set to `false`,
        the API will respond with a count of all SSIDs that have been explicitly overridden at the specified
        site identifier (`siteId`). - When `_inherited` is `true` then - In the case where a non-global `siteId`
        is accompanied by the `_inherited` flag set to true, the API is tasked with returning a count that
        aggregates the following - The number of SSIDs inherited from the global level. - The number of SSIDs
        derived from the immediate parent site where an override is present.
