        `ERROR_INITIALIZED_TIMEOUT` | The device stopped contacting PnP server while collecting initial device
        information. | | `SUDI_AUTHORIZING` | The device is undergoing Secure Unique Device Identifier (SUDI)
        authorization. | | `ERROR_SUDI_AUTHORIZING` | The device failed during SUDI authorization. | |
        `SUDI_AUTHORIZED` | The device has successfully completed SUDI authorization. | | `EXECUTING_WORKFLOW` |
        The device is actively executing its onboarding workflow. | | `EXECUTED_WORKFLOW` | The device has
        successfully completed its onboarding workflow. | | `ERROR_EXECUTING_WORKFLOW` | The device encountered
        an error while executing the onboarding workflow. | | `EXECUTING_RESET` | The device is currently being
