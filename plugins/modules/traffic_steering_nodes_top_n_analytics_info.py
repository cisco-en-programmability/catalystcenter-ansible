module: traffic_steering_nodes_top_n_analytics_info
short_description: Information module for Traffic Steering Nodes Top N Analytics
description:
  - Get all Traffic Steering Nodes Top N Analytics. - > This API retrieves the top switches data used by traffic steering
    policies across the network. It provides detailed analytics on the most utilized network nodes, focusing on switches that
    play a critical role in managing and directing network traffic. By accessing this data, network administrators can gain
    valuable insights into network performance and usage patterns. This information is essential for optimizing network operations,
    identifying potential bottlenecks, and ensuring efficient traffic flow. The API supports strategic planning and resource
    allocation by highlighting which switches are most actively involved in traffic management.
