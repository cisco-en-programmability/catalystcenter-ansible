"""
Ansible module for YAML playbook generation of SDA host port migration configurations.

The module exports port assignments and port channels from a source SDA fabric
device and writes an onboarding-compatible YAML payload for the destination
device. Optional interface mappings can remap selected source interfaces while
all unmapped source interfaces remain 1:1.

short_description: Generate SDA host port migration YAML configurations.
description:
- Generates YAML configuration compatible with
  C(sda_host_port_onboarding_workflow_manager) by reading port assignments and
  port channels from a source device and targeting a destination device.
- Supports 1:1 interface migration by default.
- Supports partial interface remap with C(interface_mappings). Source interfaces
  listed in mappings are remapped only when they exist in the source device's
  extracted port assignments or port channel member interfaces. Unmapped
  interfaces keep the same interface name unless C(only_mapped_interfaces) is
  enabled.

        The method mirrors the onboarding generator's port channel retrieval
        workflow: read all port channels, resolve requested fabric sites, group
        records by fabric and network device, transform API fields with
        modify_parameters(), resolve device management IP addresses, and build
        final YAML payload blocks. The migration differences are that only
        records from source_device_ip are selected, ip_address is populated from
        destination_device_ip, and optional member interface_mappings are applied.

        Args:
            network_element (dict): Network element configuration containing
                api_family, api_function, reverse_mapping_function, and filters.
            filters (dict): Filter wrapper containing component_specific_filters
                for port channel migration entries.

        Returns:
            list: Empty list until the final schema component is processed, then
            the merged destination onboarding payload.
