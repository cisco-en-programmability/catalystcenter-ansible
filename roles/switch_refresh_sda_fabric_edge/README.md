# Ansible Role: switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge

This role refreshes multiple SDA edge switches as a stage-batched workflow.
All replacement devices in one batch complete a stage before the batch moves to
the next stage. Workflow managers receive the complete device set wherever they
support bulk input, so the second device does not wait for the first device's
entire prepare flow.

The role has two phases:

1. `prepare` onboards all replacement devices, adds them to inventory, assigns
   the `ACCESS` inventory role, provisions them, adds them to the fabric as
   `EDGE_NODE`, and migrates host-port configuration for every mapping.
2. `cleanup_old` snapshots and deletes host-port configuration from all old
   devices, removes them from the fabric, unprovisions them, and deletes them
   from inventory. When hostname transfer is enabled, it first captures the old
   hostnames and replacement identities in durable manifests and always renames
   the replacements after deletion. The same phase can resume only the hostname
   work from those manifests after a partial failure.

`switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_batches` is the only supported input model.

## Execution model

Before any replacement workflow changes, the role validates every batch,
resolves every old-device mapping, rejects cross-batch target collisions, and
confirms each old migration source is an `EDGE_NODE` in the stated fabric. It
then executes each immutable batch plan through these barriers:

```text
validate all batches and old-device sources
  -> optional SWIM import/golden tag for the batch site and image family
  -> Discovery or LAN Automation for all replacements in one batch
  -> add all replacements to inventory
  -> wait for the exact replacement IP set to become inventory-ready and,
     when device-info lookup is enabled, verify ACCESS in the same response
  -> provision all replacements
  -> verify every replacement is provisioned to the configured site
  -> add all replacements to fabric
  -> resolve every old-to-new mapping
  -> generate and apply one combined host-onboarding payload
```

Calls within a stage use the workflow manager's native multi-device behavior.
This is stage batching, not a promise that every Catalyst Center API operation
runs on a separate thread. Separate entries in `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_batches` are
processed in list order; place devices that should advance together in the same
batch.

The role stops before the next stage when the current stage fails. Workflow
manager operations are not transactional, so rerun the idempotent prepare phase
after correcting a partial stage failure.

Hostname transfer is independent of the onboarding method. Both Discovery- and
LAN Automation-onboarded replacements use the same LAN Automation hostname
update operation after they are Managed and report `Reachable` or
`Ping Reachable` with inventory role `ACCESS` in Catalyst Center. The role
captures each desired hostname from the live old-device inventory record; users
do not supply a replacement hostname for this phase.

## Requirements

- `cisco.catalystcenter` collection and a compatible Catalyst Center SDK
- Python 3.9 or later; prepare has the higher module-specific minimum below
- Prepare uses the raw `network_device_info` and
  `sda_provision_device_info` information modules. Those modules require
  `ansible.utils`, Catalyst Center SDK 3.1.6.0.2 or later, and Python 3.12 or
  later on the Ansible controller. LAN Automation has the same minimums.
- Golden-image preparation requires the requested image to be available in the
  Catalyst Center image repository, or a valid SWIM `import_image_details`
  source, and the exact Catalyst Center device-image family name
- Old devices must remain in Catalyst Center until host migration and cleanup
  complete
- Device credentials and Catalyst Center credentials should come from Ansible
  Vault or another secret store

SWIM image preparation, Discovery, LAN Automation, and replacement-inventory
calls suppress Ansible task output and manager file/debug logging because their
nested configurations can contain image-source, device, SNMP, HTTP, or IS-IS
secrets. This protection applies even when global Catalyst Center debug or file
logging is enabled.

## Batch schema

```yaml
switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_batches:
  - name: sjc-bldg23-edge-refresh
    fabric_site_name_hierarchy: Global/USA/San Jose/BLDG23
    onboarding_method: discovery

    new_devices:
      device_ips:
        - "192.0.2.20"
        - "192.0.2.21"

    device_mapping:
      - old:
          hostname: old-edge-01.example.test
        new:
          management_ip: "192.0.2.20"
        interface_migration:
          only_mapped: true
          port_assignments:
            - source: GigabitEthernet1/0/5
              destination: GigabitEthernet1/0/4
          port_channels: []

      - old:
          serial_number: OLD-SERIAL-0002
        new:
          management_ip: "192.0.2.21"
        interface_migration:
          only_mapped: false
          port_assignments: []
          port_channels:
            - source: GigabitEthernet1/0/47
              destination: TenGigabitEthernet1/1/1
```

`fabric_site_name_hierarchy` must be the complete hierarchy of the SDA fabric
site or fabric zone containing the old and replacement edge devices. For a
zone-level refresh, keep the zone suffix, for example
`Global/USA/San Jose/BLDG23/Floor1`; the role uses that same fabric target for
membership validation, fabric add/delete, and host-port migration.

`new_devices.device_ips` is the authoritative replacement-device set. Each
`device_mapping` entry must:

- use `old` with exactly one non-empty `management_ip`, `hostname`,
  `serial_number`, or `mac_address`;
- use `new.management_ip` as the only key in `new`, with a unique value from
  `new_devices.device_ips`; and
- optionally use `interface_migration.only_mapped` as a boolean; and
- use lists of unique `source`/`destination` pairs under
  `interface_migration.port_assignments` and
  `interface_migration.port_channels` when supplied.

`interface_migration.port_assignments` and
`interface_migration.port_channels` are intentionally separate. A generic
interface-mapping shorthand is not accepted because applying one destination to
both components can produce an unsafe, ambiguous migration. A destination
interface cannot appear in both lists for one replacement device. Unknown keys
at every mapping level are rejected so spelling mistakes cannot silently change
cleanup targets.
MAC addresses accept colon- or hyphen-separated hexadecimal octets and are
normalized before lookup; serial-number matching is case-insensitive.

`interface_migration.only_mapped` is evaluated per old-to-new device mapping and
applies to both migration components for that mapping. It defaults to `false`,
which preserves the existing behavior: explicitly mapped interfaces are renamed
and all other source interfaces retain their names for a 1:1 migration. When it
is `true`, generated port assignments contain only interfaces listed in
`interface_migration.port_assignments`, and generated port channels contain
only members listed in `interface_migration.port_channels`; port channels with
no remaining mapped members are omitted. An empty mapping list therefore
excludes that component for the device. When the option is `true`, at least one
of the two interface-mapping lists must be non-empty.

This option limits the replacement payload generated during `prepare`. It does
not make `cleanup_old` selective: cleanup continues to snapshot and delete all
host-port configuration from each old switch before the switch is removed.

When host onboarding is enabled, mappings must exactly cover the replacement
IP set. Prepare may omit `device_mapping` only when
`switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_host_onboarding_enabled` is `false`. Cleanup always requires
complete mappings.

The role rejects duplicate replacement IPs, duplicate old identifiers,
duplicate resolved old management IPs within or across batches, partial
mappings, and any old target that overlaps any replacement IP in the complete
run.

## Discovery onboarding

For reachable replacement management IPs, minimal input is sufficient:

```yaml
onboarding_method: discovery
new_devices:
  device_ips:
    - "192.0.2.20"
    - "192.0.2.21"
```

The role generates a multi-device Discovery configuration using Catalyst
Center global credentials. A complete custom configuration can be supplied
instead:

Generated input may override `discovery_name`, `protocol_order` (`ssh`,
`telnet`, or `ssh, telnet`), non-negative integer `discovery_retry`, and boolean
`use_global_credentials`; these values are validated for every batch before any
Discovery starts.

```yaml
new_devices:
  device_ips:
    - "192.0.2.20"
    - "192.0.2.21"
  discovery_config:
    - discovery_name: sjc-bldg23-replacements
      discovery_type: MULTI RANGE
      ip_address_list:
        - "192.0.2.20"
        - "192.0.2.21"
      protocol_order: ssh
      retry: 2
      use_global_credentials: true
```

The combined IP set in a custom `discovery_config` must exactly match
`new_devices.device_ips`. A custom configuration replaces the generated stage
configuration rather than merging with it.

## LAN Automation onboarding

LAN Automation uses one launch configuration containing every replacement:

```yaml
fabric_site_name_hierarchy: Global/USA/San Jose/BLDG23/Floor1
onboarding_method: lan_automation
new_devices:
  device_ips:
    - "192.0.2.30"
    - "192.0.2.31"
  lan_automation_config:
    - lan_automation:
        discovered_device_site_name_hierarchy: Global/USA/San Jose/BLDG23
        primary_device_management_ip_address: "198.51.100.10"
        primary_device_interface_names:
          - GigabitEthernet2/0/7
        ip_pools:
          - ip_pool_name: LAN_AUTO_MAIN
            ip_pool_role: MAIN_POOL
          - ip_pool_name: LAN_AUTO_P2P
            ip_pool_role: PHYSICAL_LINK_POOL
        discovery_devices:
          - device_serial_number: NEW-SERIAL-0001
            device_host_name: new-edge-01
            device_site_name_hierarchy: Global/USA/San Jose/BLDG23/Floor1
            device_management_ip_address: "192.0.2.30"
          - device_serial_number: NEW-SERIAL-0002
            device_host_name: new-edge-02
            device_site_name_hierarchy: Global/USA/San Jose/BLDG23/Floor1
            device_management_ip_address: "192.0.2.31"
        launch_and_wait: true
```

These hierarchy values are intentionally different when the fabric target is
below the LAN Automation discovery site. `fabric_site_name_hierarchy` uses the
complete target hierarchy. `discovered_device_site_name_hierarchy` can use that
same hierarchy or any complete ancestor hierarchy, including when multiple
hierarchy levels follow the discovery site. A discovery device's
`device_site_name_hierarchy` is optional, but must equal the complete
`fabric_site_name_hierarchy` when supplied. Partial hierarchy-segment matches
are rejected.

The discovered management IP set must exactly match `device_ips`.
`launch_and_wait` must be the boolean `true`. After the manager returns, the
role waits for two consecutive controller-wide checks with no active LAN
Automation sessions before starting inventory.

For a resume run, `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_lan_automation_enabled: false` skips only the
launch. The complete launch-only configuration, including `launch_and_wait:
true` and the exact serial/IP target set, is still required, and the same
two-poll inactivity barrier still runs before inventory.

### Optional golden-image preparation

For LAN Automation batches, the role can call the existing `swim` role before
launching LAN Automation. Enable it explicitly and describe the desired image
under `new_devices`:

```yaml
switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_swim_enabled: true
switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_swim_config_verify: true

switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_batches:
  - name: sjc-bldg23-edge-refresh
    fabric_site_name_hierarchy: Global/USA/San Jose/BLDG23
    onboarding_method: lan_automation
    new_devices:
      device_ips:
        - "192.0.2.30"
      golden_image:
        image_name: cat9k_iosxe.17.12.04.SPA.bin
        device_image_family_name: Cisco Catalyst 9300 Switch
      lan_automation_config:
        - lan_automation:
            discovered_device_site_name_hierarchy: Global/USA/San Jose/BLDG23
            discovery_devices:
              - device_serial_number: NEW-SERIAL-0001
                device_management_ip_address: "192.0.2.30"
            launch_and_wait: true
```

This tag-only form requires the image to exist in the Catalyst Center image
repository. To import and tag in one SWIM operation, add the module's existing
`import_image_details` structure:

```yaml
golden_image:
  image_name: cat9k_iosxe.17.12.04.SPA.bin
  device_image_family_name: Cisco Catalyst 9300 Switch
  import_image_details:
    type: remote
    url_details:
      payload:
        - source_url:
            - "{{ vault_switch_golden_image_url }}"
          is_third_party: false
```

The switch-refresh wrapper accepts one first-party image per batch: one remote
URL payload or one CCO image name. The selected source filename/image name must
equal `golden_image.image_name`. A remote URL must end with that exact filename
and cannot contain a query string or fragment because the existing SWIM module
treats those suffixes as filename text. Local-file, multi-image, scheduled,
third-party, distribution, activation, deletion, and untagging operations are
outside this role's input contract. A scalar CCO `image_name` is normalized to
the one-item list expected by the existing SWIM module.

The role derives `site_name` from `fabric_site_name_hierarchy` and always
generates `device_role: ALL` and `tagging: true`; those fields cannot be
overridden. It passes one direct configuration entry to the existing `swim`
role, not the workflow example's `import_images`/`golden_tag_images` wrapper.
It does not distribute or activate an image against a replacement device before
that device is managed in inventory. LAN Automation performs the supported
day-zero image installation after the golden assignment is established.

Golden-image input is rejected for Discovery batches. Every LAN Automation
batch must declare `golden_image` when both SWIM support and the LAN Automation
launch are enabled. If either toggle is false, `golden_image` is optional; a
retained declaration is still validated and preserved for a resume, but it is
not executed. Batches may share the same site/family/image claim, but
conflicting images for the same site and device-image family are rejected
during all-batch preflight, before any controller mutation.

SWIM runs only when both
`switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_swim_enabled` and
`switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_lan_automation_enabled` are true. Disabling the
LAN Automation launch for a resume therefore skips SWIM too. A SWIM failure
stops the batch before LAN Automation. A later LAN Automation failure can be
rerun safely; the golden assignment is persistent desired state and is not
removed by cleanup.

This role trusts a successful SWIM call and does not accept or validate a
separate expected software version. Actual day-zero installation still depends
on Catalyst Center and platform prerequisites, including a platform supported
for LAN Automation image upgrade and the required device install mode. Use a
post-onboarding day-N SWIM workflow for platforms that do not support the
LAN Automation image-upgrade path.

## Generated and custom workflow input

The role generates inventory, provision, and fabric configurations from
`device_ips`. Inventory addition requires credentials:

```yaml
switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_inventory_credentials:
  username: "{{ vault_switch_cli_username }}"
  password: "{{ vault_switch_cli_password }}"
  enable_password: "{{ vault_switch_enable_password }}"
  cli_transport: ssh
  type: NETWORK_DEVICE
```

Complete stage configurations can be placed under `new_devices` when generated
defaults are insufficient:

```yaml
new_devices:
  device_ips:
    - "192.0.2.20"
    - "192.0.2.21"

  inventory_config:
    - ip_address_list:
        - "192.0.2.20"
        - "192.0.2.21"
      username: "{{ vault_switch_cli_username }}"
      password: "{{ vault_switch_cli_password }}"
      enable_password: "{{ vault_switch_enable_password }}"
      cli_transport: ssh
      type: NETWORK_DEVICE

  provision_config:
    - site_name_hierarchy: Global/USA/San Jose/BLDG23
      management_ip_address: "192.0.2.20"
    - site_name_hierarchy: Global/USA/San Jose/BLDG23
      management_ip_address: "192.0.2.21"

  fabric_devices_config:
    - fabric_devices:
        fabric_name: Global/USA/San Jose/BLDG23
        device_config:
          - device_ip: "192.0.2.20"
            device_roles:
              - EDGE_NODE
          - device_ip: "192.0.2.21"
            device_roles:
              - EDGE_NODE
```

Each supplied configuration replaces the generated configuration for that
stage. Its device set must exactly equal `device_ips`. Provision entries must
use the configured provisioning site. Fabric entries must use the batch fabric
site and the `EDGE_NODE` role. Inventory role enforcement remains `ACCESS`.
Generated `inventory_credentials` accepts only connection/authentication fields;
it cannot override target IPs, device type, role, or request unrelated inventory
actions. Custom inventory entries are restricted to those same fields plus the
authoritative target list and optional exact `ACCESS` role.

## Inventory and provisioning guards

The prepare flow adds two role-level safety barriers around the existing
provisioning role. These checks do not change `provision_workflow_manager` or
the other included workflow managers.

When provisioning is enabled, the role polls live inventory after inventory
addition and before calling the `provision` role. The response must contain
exactly one record for every IP in `new_devices.device_ips`, with no missing,
unexpected, or duplicate management IPs. Every record must report all of the
following:

- `collectionStatus: Managed`;
- `managementState: Managed`;
- `reachabilityStatus: Reachable`;
- a wired `family` of `Switches and Hubs` or `Routers`; and
- an `inventoryStatusDetail` general result containing `SUCCESS`.

With `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_device_info_lookup_enabled: true` (the
default), this same polled response must also report `role: ACCESS` for every
replacement. This avoids a second controller lookup on provisioning runs. When
provisioning is disabled for a resume, the existing exact `ACCESS` lookup still
runs independently; setting the device-info toggle to `false` continues to
disable only that optional role policy, not provisioning readiness.

The barrier deliberately does not require `managedAtleastOnce`. Catalyst Center
can report that field as `false` while all of the current readiness signals
above are complete, so using it as a gate could reject a device that is ready
for provisioning.

After any enabled provisioning stage, and always before an enabled fabric-add
stage, the role polls every authoritative replacement IP until Catalyst Center
reports provisioning `status: success`, returns that same management IP, and
returns the exact configured `siteNameHierarchy`. The expected hierarchy is the
batch `provision_site_name_hierarchy` when supplied, otherwise
`fabric_site_name_hierarchy`. This postcondition also runs when the provisioning
stage is disabled for a resume, so fabric enrollment cannot begin merely
because an earlier workflow call returned without provisioning the devices.

The global polling controls and defaults are:

```yaml
switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_inventory_readiness_timeout: 1200
switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_inventory_readiness_poll_interval: 10
switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_provision_validation_timeout: 1200
switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_provision_validation_poll_interval: 10
```

Each batch can override them with the corresponding unprefixed keys:

```yaml
switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_batches:
  - name: sjc-bldg23-edge-refresh
    fabric_site_name_hierarchy: Global/USA/San Jose/BLDG23
    inventory_readiness_timeout: 1800
    inventory_readiness_poll_interval: 15
    provision_validation_timeout: 1800
    provision_validation_poll_interval: 15
    new_devices:
      device_ips:
        - "192.0.2.20"
```

Timeout and poll-interval values must be positive integers. Exhausting either
barrier fails the batch before its next mutating stage.

## Cleanup safety

Normal cleanup is separately gated by `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_cleanup_old: true`.
Manifest-resume mode instead requires `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_cleanup_old: false` and
never invokes a destructive cleanup task. Before any normal destructive
workflow starts, the role resolves and validates immutable plans for every
batch, confirms that all old management IPs are globally unique and distinct
from every replacement IP, and verifies exact old `EDGE_NODE` membership in
each stated fabric.

Cleanup then proceeds by stage for the whole batch:

1. When hostname transfer is enabled, resolve the live old and replacement
   inventory identities, prove every replacement is an `ACCESS` device and an
   `EDGE_NODE` in the requested fabric, validate hostname ownership and
   collisions across all batches, and persist a mode-`0600` recovery manifest
   before any deletion.
2. Generate and validate one scoped payload for old-device port assignments and
   port channels.
3. Delete the aggregate host-port payload.
4. Remove all old devices from the fabric and verify their absence.
5. Unprovision all old devices.
6. Remove all old devices from inventory, prove their IP, UUID, and expanded
   stack-member serial identities are absent, and prove each desired name is
   unclaimed or already belongs to its mapped replacement.
7. When hostname transfer is enabled, submit one aggregate LAN Automation
   hostname-update payload for the pending replacements and strictly verify
   their identities, `ACCESS` role, fabric `EDGE_NODE` membership, and resulting
   hostnames.

Hostname transfer does not use a hostname from `new_devices` or from a new
mapping key. An `old.hostname` value may still be used as the old-device lookup
identifier, but the desired replacement hostname is always the live inventory
value captured during cleanup preflight. The capture also records old and new
UUIDs and serial numbers so a later IP reassignment cannot rename the wrong
device.

The per-batch hostname-transfer manifest is written beneath
`switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_hostname_transfer_manifest_dir` before destructive cleanup. It
contains no credentials and records a version, controller and batch identity,
an input fingerprint, immutable old/new device identities, the captured
hostname, and per-device progress. Existing manifests must be regular files;
symlinks and special files are rejected. This directory has no default when
hostname transfer is enabled: set it explicitly to persistent controller-local
storage that survives reboot and temporary-file cleanup. Do not use `/tmp`.
The controller account must be able to create or write the selected directory;
for system paths such as `/var/lib`, create it with suitable ownership before
running cleanup or use an appropriately scoped `become` configuration.

The generated manager input is update-only and batched:

```yaml
lan_automation_config:
  - lan_automated_device_update:
      hostname_update_devices:
        - device_management_ip_address: "192.0.2.20"
          new_host_name: old-edge-01
        - device_management_ip_address: "192.0.2.21"
          new_host_name: old-edge-02
```

This payload is generated internally from the manifest. Do not add it to the
replacement onboarding `new_devices.lan_automation_config`.

The full captured hostname remains unchanged in the manifest, hostname
ownership checks, and final convergence target. For the LAN Automation update,
the role submits only the leftmost hostname label because Catalyst Center and
the device domain configuration supply the DNS suffix. This prevents a captured
FQDN such as `old-edge-01.example.test` from becoming
`old-edge-01.example.test.example.test`.

Hostname convergence is compared case-insensitively because network hostnames
are case-insensitive and Catalyst Center may normalize their letter case. If
the replacement's configured DNS domain differs from the captured old-device
domain, exact FQDN convergence fails safely; hostname transfer does not change
device or site DNS-domain settings.

Hostname transfer supports at most 100 mappings in one batch. Because the old
hostname must be released before reuse, enabling it for normal cleanup also
requires `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_cleanup_inventory_enabled: true`. Manifest-resume mode
does not repeat inventory deletion; it proves that the captured old identities
are already absent.

The Catalyst Center rename does not update external DNS, DHCP, ISE, monitoring,
certificate, or CMDB records; coordinate those systems separately when they
depend on the switch hostname.

Wireless SSID mappings are not included in the cleanup generator filters.
`switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_allow_empty_host_port_config: true` permits a completely empty
generated payload. A non-empty partial payload is rejected.

Run cleanup only after physical cutover and application validation. The role
does not support combining prepare and cleanup in one run.

If cleanup fails after fabric removal but before unprovisioning or inventory
deletion, rerun only the unfinished batch entries with
`switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_cleanup_host_onboarding_enabled: false` and
`switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_cleanup_fabric_enabled: false`, while keeping
`switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_fabric_validation_enabled: true`. The role proves those old
devices are already absent before unprovisioning or inventory deletion. Remove
fully completed batches from the rerun input because their inventory identities
no longer exist to preflight.

If any aggregate cleanup stage succeeded for only part of a batch, split the
rerun input by actual state and use separate cleanup runs because stage toggles
apply to the whole role invocation. Run fabric-absent devices with host cleanup
and fabric removal disabled, and run still-present devices in another run (also
disabling host cleanup if that stage already succeeded). After partial inventory
deletion, include only identities still present in inventory. Exact
target-coverage and presence/absence barriers intentionally reject a mixed
partial batch.

When hostname transfer fails after old-device deletion, do not rerun destructive
cleanup to recover the names. Run `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_phase: cleanup_old` with
`switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_hostname_transfer_resume_from_manifest: true`, the original
batch definitions, and the same manifest directory. Resume mode bypasses old
device resolution and every destructive cleanup stage. It loads all manifests
and validates them before submitting an update, verifies their controller,
batch, site, fingerprint, and replacement identities, skips devices whose
hostname is already correct, and updates only pending devices. A partially
successful bulk request therefore converges safely on rerun. A changed
replacement UUID or serial number, an old device that is still present, or a
hostname owned by another device fails closed before another update is
submitted.

- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_hostname_transfer_enabled`: capture old hostnames and apply
  them to their replacements; default `false`
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_hostname_transfer_resume_from_manifest`: under `cleanup_old`,
  bypass destructive stages and resume hostname transfer from validated durable
  manifests; default `false`
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_hostname_transfer_manifest_dir`: required, explicit absolute
  directory for durable per-batch hostname-transfer manifests when transfer is
  enabled; use persistent storage, not `/tmp`
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_hostname_transfer_timeout`: maximum time allowed for the
  switch-refresh wrapper around the update operation
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_hostname_transfer_poll_interval`: polling interval for the
  bounded update wrapper
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_hostname_validation_retries`: number of post-update inventory
  validation attempts
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_hostname_validation_interval`: delay between post-update
  inventory validation attempts
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_work_dir`: generated payload directory
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_inventory_credentials`: default replacement CLI credentials
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_inventory_readiness_timeout`: maximum time to
  wait for the exact replacement set to report complete, reachable wired
  inventory data before provisioning; default `1200` seconds
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_inventory_readiness_poll_interval`: delay
  between replacement inventory-readiness checks; default `10` seconds
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_provision_validation_timeout`: maximum time
  to wait for replacements to report the exact provisioning IP/site
  postcondition before fabric add; default `1200` seconds
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_provision_validation_poll_interval`: delay
  between provisioning postcondition checks; default `10` seconds
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_device_info_lookup_enabled`: resolve old device identifiers
  and verify exact replacement `ACCESS` inventory coverage before downstream
  stages; when false, every `old` mapping must use `management_ip` and the
  replacement inventory/role postcondition is skipped
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_allow_empty_host_port_config`: permit a completely empty
  generated migration or cleanup payload
- Per-device `interface_migration.only_mapped`: migrate only explicitly listed
  port assignments and port-channel members for that old-to-new mapping;
  default `false`
- Per-batch `migration_output_file`: optional absolute prepare payload path
- Per-batch `old_host_port_cleanup_file`: optional absolute cleanup payload
  path
- Per-batch `inventory_readiness_timeout`,
  `inventory_readiness_poll_interval`, `provision_validation_timeout`, and
  `provision_validation_poll_interval`: positive-integer overrides for the
  corresponding role-level polling controls

Stage toggles:

- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_swim_enabled`
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_discovery_enabled`
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_lan_automation_enabled`
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_inventory_enabled`
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_inventory_role_update_enabled`
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_provision_enabled`

- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_cleanup_host_onboarding_enabled`
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_cleanup_fabric_enabled`
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_cleanup_unprovision_enabled`
- `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_cleanup_inventory_enabled`

Turning off an earlier stage means the required Catalyst Center postcondition
already exists. Inventory readiness is still required before an enabled
provisioning stage, and the exact IP/site provisioning postcondition is still
required before an enabled fabric-add stage. Replacement fabric validation is
independent of fabric add.
Cleanup cannot unprovision or delete inventory unless it removes the old fabric
devices in the same run or validates that they are already absent.
Keep `switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_device_info_lookup_enabled: true` for production prepare
runs so provisioning, fabric, and host migration cannot proceed without exact
replacement `ACCESS` inventory coverage.

Hostname transfer always performs live inventory lookups even when
`switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_device_info_lookup_enabled` is `false`, because the desired
hostname and immutable replacement identity must not come from user input or
stale in-memory state.

Generated migration and cleanup output paths must be absolute. Their parent
directories are created when absent and verified writable during global
preflight; an existing directory, symlink, or special file is never removed as
an output file.

## Run the playbooks

Prepare all replacements in each batch:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_prepare.yml
```

After cutover, clean up old devices:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_cleanup_old.yml
```

To resume hostname transfer after cleanup, invoke the role with the original
batch definitions and manifest directory:

```yaml
- name: Resume replacement hostname transfer
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_phase: cleanup_old
    switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_cleanup_old: false
    switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_hostname_transfer_enabled: true
    switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_hostname_transfer_resume_from_manifest: true
    switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_batches: "{{ switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_batches_from_cleanup }}"
  roles:
    - role: cisco.catalystcenter.switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge
```

See `playbooks/vars/switch_refresh_sda_fabric_edge_usecase.yml` for a complete Vault-oriented
example.
